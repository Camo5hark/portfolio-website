            <p>Welcome to my beautiful website. My name is Andrew (GitHub: Camo5hark) and I am a 21-year-old cybersecurity student at Penn State University expecting to graduate in 2027.</p>
            <p>I am also a hobby programmer in languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python. I enjoy creating programs involving video game modifications, pipelined graphics (OpenGL & Vulkan), and the GPGPU paradigm.<br />I always aim for efficiency and memory-safety in my programs.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy listening to and making music.</p>
            <p style="color: purple;">Fun fact: <i>Camo5hark</i> (my childish username for everything) was my xbox gamertag when I was 10 and I have used it for everything since.</p>
            <p>
                <i style="color: gray;">(P.S. web design is not my strong suit if you couldn't tell)</i>
